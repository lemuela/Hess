<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: bold">Comment:</span>  As for the ancestry of Abraham Clevenger, Mr. Robert Pittman of Canton, Illinois has
researched the Clevenger and Pittman families extensively and he suggests that the children of
George and Deliverance (Horner) Clevenger were: John, born 1738, married on 9 March 1760 in
Monmouth County, New Jersey by B.M. John Dickerson, and John Brown to Mary Horner, daughter
of Isaac Horner of New Hanover, Burlington County, New Jersey; Thomas born circa 1740;
Abraham born 1741, married on 9 March 1760 in Monmouth County, New Jersey; to Mary Pitman,
the same day by the same ministers that married his brother John and Mary Horner; (Mr. George
Griffiths of Tempe, Arizona, in his book entitled &#8220;<i><span style="text-decoration: underline">Clevengers Pioneers and Descendants</span></i>&#8221; wrote:
&#8220;I have reasoned that Abraham was the son of George on the basis that first, George was the only
logical father for a son born in 1741.  Secondly, Abraham&#8217;s migration pattern parallels that of
George and family in that Abraham was in Virginia circa 1773 even though he then settled in
Bedford County, Pennsylvania (which he probably had the opportunity of seeing and evaluating en
route to the Shenandoah Valley), finally circumstantial evidence suggests that he was a brother of
John; Benjamin, born circa 1753; Asa, born circa 1748; Joseph, born 15 September 1750; Nancy
Ann, born 1752; Eben, born 1755 and a twin brother to Edwin; George, born circa 1756, possibly
in Frederick County, Virginia&#8221;. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: bold">Please Note: </span> We will chart Mr. Pittman&#8217;s theory of the Abraham Clevenger&#8217;s ancestral lines

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: bold">Comment:</span>  At this writing it is uncertain who Mary&#8217;s parents were.  However, Samuel Danford
married Mary Wright, widow of Joseph Wright.  Samuel and Mary had a daughter who died prior
to 1745.  The unnamed Danford daughter married a Richard Pittman who was a Quaker and who was
born between 1700-1710, in New Jersey and had a daughter named Mary Pit(t)man.  This is
surmised from Samuel Danford&#8217;s will that mentioned a granddaughter Mary Pittman and a son-in-law Richard Pittman.  This Richard Pittman and his unnamed Danford wife may have been the
parents of Mary Pittman.

<p style="text-align: justify">With all of the above &#8220;coincidences,&#8221; it is very possible that the Clevengers and Pittmans were
friends in New York and England.  They may have come to America at the same time, or they may
have arrived at different times.  However, there were Clevengers and Pittmans in Devonshire,
England, and they are also found in New York, New Jersey, Virginia and Pennsylvania.  While the </p>
<p style="text-align: justify">&#8220;coincidences&#8221; could mean nothing, it could mean the families have been acquainted with each other
since the 1600&#8217;s.  At the time of this writing, the above stated &#8220;coincidences&#8221; seem to be very
definite possibilities.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: bold">Comment:</span>  With all of the above &#8220;coincidences,&#8221; it is very possible that the Clevengers and
Pittmans were friends in New York and England.  They may have come to America at the same time,
or they may have arrived at different times.  However, there were Clevengers and Pittmans in
Devonshire, England, and they are also found in New York, New Jersey, Virginia and Pennsylvania. 
While the &#8220;coincidences&#8221; could mean nothing, it could mean the families have been acquainted with

Benjamin Graves lived in the year 1684.&#8221;  He moved to Saybrook, Connecticut, and lived at
Pattaconke (northern part of Saybrook), where he bought land 25 January 1703.  He deeded half of

Pataconke and Pattaquonek).  &#8220;The committee for highway improvements were to layout a good and

a part of Saybrook.  It is now the town of Chester, Connecticut.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: bold">46.  James Avery</span> (Christopher, #92) was born 1620, in England.
<a href="#WPEndnote281" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote281">281</a>  He first married Joanna
Greenslade, the daughter of Edward Greenslade, 10 November 1643, Gloucester, Massachusetts.
After the death of Joanna he then married Abigail Ingraham, 4 July, 1698.
<a href="#WPEndnote282" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote282">282</a>  He signed his will
dated 8 May 1693.
<a href="#WPEndnote283" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote283">283</a>  James died 18 April 1700, in Groton, New London Co., Connecticut. </p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">James Avery was the only child of Christopher and properly the founder of the family that we call
the Groton Averys, was born in England about 1620. He came to America with his father, and lived
at Gloucester for several years. </p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">In addition to his grant of land, 19 October 1650, and of a town lot on Cape Ann Lane, early in 1651,
James Avery soon received a grant of the "Little Owl Meadow," "not far from the town plot on the
North side of the Mill Brook." But ideas grew and there was a quick thirsting after large domains.
About 1652, he was granted a farm in South Groton, where lands were especially desirable, as they
might be cultivated immediately. He, however, continued to live with his family on his town lot for
several years. Early in 1653, he secured another farm, one of the "Pocketannock grants," further up
the river, in what is now the town of Ledyard.  About 1656, he built "The Hive of the Averys," at the
head of Poquonnock Plain, in the present town of Groton, a mile and a half from the River Thames.
In June 1684, the old Blinman edifice at New London, "the unadorned church and watch-tower of
the wilderness," was sold to Captain Avery for six pounds, with the condition that he should remove
it in one month's time.  According to tradition, the church was taken down and its materials carried
across the river and added to the house he had already built at Poquonnock.  In spite of this analytic
and synthetic process, the house seems to have retained some of its sacred character and, even a
century later, "the same timbers, the same boards, joyfully resounded once more to the ancient but
well remembered voices of exhortation and praise." The antique dwelling, of which we give a fine
illustration, is still in good repair and is occupied and owned, as it has ever been, by an Avery family.
With its charming situation, the old-time combination constitutes one of the most interesting and
picturesque farm-houses in the country. Here James Avery lived until he died.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">After presenting documents on 16 March 1634/5 from London&#8217;s Saint Mildred&#8217;s Parish certifying
their conformity to the rules and discipline of the Church of England, twenty year old George
Chappell and his companions took the &#8220;oath of Allegenance And Supremacie&#8221; in preparation &#8220;to be
transported to New England, imbarqued in the Christian de London, John White, Master, bound
thither.&#8221;
<a href="#WPEndnote304" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote304">304</a><sup>,</sup>
<a href="#WPEndnote305" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote305">305</a>References to the matter show that this &#8220;company of some twenty men,&#8221; the so called
Stiles party, had been assembled by Mr. Francis Stiles at Sir. Richard Saltonstall&#8217;s expense to
prepare grounds and erect houses at Windsor (then Matianuck or Matteneaug) for Saltonstall and</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">other Connecticut patentees.  The elder John Winthrop noted that their &#8220;bark of forty tons&#8221; arrived
at Boston on 16 June 1635 and that it &#8220;set forth with twenty servants, by Sir. Richard Saltonstall, to
go plant at Connecticut.&#8221;
<a href="#WPEndnote306" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote306">306</a>  Saltonstall wrote in February 1635/6 to Winthrop&#8217;s son John Jr., then
Governor at Saybrook, relating that &#8220;my pinnace had staid ten days...in the Bay&#8221; (that is, at Boston)
before making it way on around Cape Cod to Saybrook and up the Connecticut to Windsor.
<a href="#WPEndnote307" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote307">307</a>  The
party arrived within a few days of Jonathan Brewster&#8217;s letter, dated &#8220;Matianuck, 6 July 1635,&#8221;
complaining to the Plymouth company that &#8220;Massachusetts men are coming almost daily, some by
water and some by land, who are not yet determined where to settle&#8221;.  The Stiles party, after the
company from Plymouth in September 1633, included the first actual settlers of Windsor, although
they were met there by an advance contingent of the better known settlers from Dorchester.
<a href="#WPEndnote308" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote308">308</a></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">The twenty seven passengers aboard the Christian were the supervisor Francis Stiles, a master
carpenter of London, twenty workmen, some of them Stiles&#8217;s own relatives, three women, and three
children.  Ten of the workmen including George Chappell were identified by Henry Reed Stiles as
&#8220;positively known to have settled in Windsor.&#8221;  Indeed, there is no reason to believe that any fewer
than the twenty men who boarded the vessel in London actually reached Windsor; all &#8220;set forth&#8221;
from Boston on the last leg of their journey.  Chappell&#8217;s presence in Windsor, however, is not known
from any surviving records there, but only through a chance reference to him in the colony&#8217;s records. 
On 28 March 1637, the General Court at Hartford ordered &#8220;that Mr. Francis Stiles shall teach George
Chappell, Thomas Cooper, and Thomas Barber, his servants [three of the younger men aboard the
Christian], in the trade of a carpenter, according to his promise for their service of their term, behind
4 days in a week one lie to saw and slit their won work that they are to frame themselves with their
own hands together with himself or some other Master workmen&#8221;.
<a href="#WPEndnote309" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote309">309</a>  George Chappell is not
mentioned in Matthew Grant&#8217;s record of &#8220;Church things in general [as they have occurred since our]
first setting down here in Windsor, at least since Mr. Huit&#8217;s first coming up here to us August 1639.&#8221; 
In prefatory remarks to his record, Grant also informs us: &#8220;Concerning the admission of persons to
full communion I could give account of all, but judge there is no need of such as are dead and gone
from us to other places.&#8221;
<a href="#WPEndnote310" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote310">310</a></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">In July 1644, George was 5 pounds in debt to the estate of John Cattell/Catlin,
<a href="#WPEndnote311" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote311">311</a> whose widow
married one of George&#8217;s later associates, James Northam.  By then George apparently had been
married long enough to have the two unrecorded children, John and Mary, discussed below.  That
September, his wife Christian&#8217;s name first appears, in a record of their daughter Abigail&#8217;s birth at
Wethersfield.
<a href="#WPEndnote312" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote312">312</a></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">George was sometimes engaged in activities that no doubt honed the experience of those in better
positions to fashion an orderly community.  He begins in June 1645 to appear repeatedly in civil suits
and on misdemeanor charges in the colony&#8217;s court at Hartford.  He seems to have been employed
by Wethersfield&#8217;s Richard Belding, but among his other associates about that time can be recognized
one or two of the least governable characters about town.
<a href="#WPEndnote313" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote313">313</a>  An entry dated that June&#8220;Chappell, the
Tailor. Southmead.&#8221;enigmatically records the last case brought before that month&#8217;s court.  Next
September, Chappell brought a losing action against Wethersfield&#8217;s leading citizen, Leonard Chester,
and was himself fined 5 pounds &#8220;for abusing the Constable and excess in drinking.&#8221;  Richard
Belding posted bond for his good behavior and later appearance.
<a href="#WPEndnote314" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote314">314</a>  &#8220;Mr. Chester&#8221; also was fined
the same day for &#8220;resisting the Constable and other miscarriages in the Court.&#8221;  In March 1645/6,
Chappell was engaged in some litigation with John Bissell of Windsor.
<a href="#WPEndnote315" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote315">315</a></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">George subsequently lost several minor civil actions; then, in October 1648, the magistrates decreed
that George Chappell and Matthew Williams had forfeited bonds, and found the pair missing.  Their
judgment was &#8220;suspended till they shall be found or known to be at the house of Thomas Ford or
John Saddler.&#8221;  The later were given twenty four hours to give them up if they &#8220;be in either of the
houses aforesaid.&#8221;
<a href="#WPEndnote316" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote316">316</a>  This case suggests that Chappell was residing in Hockanum.  East Hartford&#8217;s
historian believed that John saddler&#8217;s ordinary (an inn or house of entertainment) was already located
on that side.
<a href="#WPEndnote317" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote317">317</a>  Certainly it was located in Hockanum later.  At the time of this warrant, Ford, a
Windsor resident, was keeping an inn at the southwest corner of State and Front streets in
Hartford.
<a href="#WPEndnote318" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote318">318</a></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">George&#8217;s residence is further indicated by a case brought in April 1649 against him by James
Northam of Hockanum for some unspecified reason, but &#8220;the defendant not appearing...the Court
orders an attachment to issue forth upon his two calves in the hands of [Northam] for his security.&#8221; 
Northam was a neighbor of Samuel Gardner and Thomas Edwards in the Glastonbury part of
Hockanum and grazed cattle with Robert Boltwood on or near Thomas Hosmer&#8217;s property across
the town line in (modern) East Hartford.  As late as June 1656, after George finally got settled in
New London, Northam was still pursuing him for debts.
<a href="#WPEndnote319" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote319">319</a></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">In September 1649, just a month before George and his wife Christian recorded a child Rachel at
Wethersfield, Mrs. Chester complained of his &#8220;misdemeanors.&#8221;
<a href="#WPEndnote320" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote320">320</a>  It was about that time New
London granted George a house lot.  It reverted for lack of improvement, but he soon reapplied and
the town on 24 February 1650/1 gave him upland, meadow, and a five acre house lot adjoining the
house lots of Andrew London, Thomas Wells, and the way or road to the house lot of Thomas
Sparks.
<a href="#WPEndnote321" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote321">321</a>  Next July, Chappell was among the men at New London who &#8220;Wrought at the Mill
Dam&#8221;.
<a href="#WPEndnote322" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote322">322</a>  Though no record of either event appears, Christian apparently died and George married
about that time Margaret (--?--), the mother of his younger children born from 1654 to 1671.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">George was still unsettled; signing by mark 020 in June 1653, he sold his recently acquired New
London upland and meadow to Mr. Richard Lord and Mr. William Gibbons of Hartford,
<a href="#WPEndnote323" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote323">323</a> the latter
of whom had extensive land holdings in Hockanum.
<a href="#WPEndnote324" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote324">324</a>  George evidently returned to Wethersfield. 
An early mutilated record with date missing shows that &#8220;George Chappell of Wethersfield&#8221; recorded
an earmark, &#8220;and this he hath formerly [torn] continued it.
<a href="#WPEndnote325" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote325">325</a>  His first child with wife Margaret, a
son George born on 17 March 1653/4, was recorded both at New London and Wethersfield.  A week
later, on 24 March, George was fined at New London &#8220;for his being drunk contrary to law,&#8221; but he
had well known company with him who received identical fines.  Jacob Waterhouse and Thomas
Hungerford.
<a href="#WPEndnote326" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote326">326</a></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">By March 1653/4 George had evidently returned to New London, where his last six children were
recorded from 1656 to 1671.  He sold his house lot in town in December 1658 to the Indian
missionary William Thomson and soon moved to the Jordan District (modern Waterford) where, in
December 1663, he was granted six acres for a house lot on Jordan River, the record of which is the
first mention of the stream by that name.  Next year he had a house on it &#8220;by Naihantic way side,&#8221;
thus being the first settler in that community.
<a href="#WPEndnote327" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote327">327</a>  In August 1671, George was among the New
London inhabitants involved in a &#8220;riot&#8221; over land on the boundary of that town with Lyme.
<a href="#WPEndnote328" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote328">328</a>  Later
records indicate that he had an interest in Lyme (probably modern East Lyme) early enough to have
a stream there named for him.  A grant in July 1674 to Lyme&#8217;s Wolston Brockway was a &#8220;pess of
land on the west side of Chappell Brook.&#8221;
<a href="#WPEndnote329" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote329">329</a>  In September 1674 and September 1674, with consent
of &#8220;his wife&#8221; Margaret and both signing by marks, George Chappell, Sr., of New London,
Connecticut sold parcels in &#8220;the General Neck&#8221; to Samuel Chester and Mr. James Rogers, Sr., of
New London, Connecticut.
<a href="#WPEndnote330" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote330">330</a></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">George&#8217;s estate, house, land, and personal property in 1682, was to be distributed to the Arelict...to
bring up children.&#8221;  Order also was made for distribution to the children John and George Chappell;
Mary Daniels; Rachel Crocker; Elizabeth, Hester, and Sarah Chappell; and to &#8220;the two sons
Nathaniel and Caleb the housing and lands.
<a href="#WPEndnote331" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote331">331</a>  Margaret was &#8220;widow Chappell&#8221; admitted to New
London&#8221;  First Church on 15 March 1694.

<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: bold">Notes &amp; Comments:</span>  In a search for the family names of George Chappell&#8217;s two wives, Christian
and Margaret family names we find little.  For Christian, especially, there is no clue to her maiden
name, though it would seem that George met her somewhere in the Connecticut River valley.  But
for Margaret there are some indications worth noting.  She plainly was younger than Christian and
born near 1630; she gave birth to children from 1654 to 1671 and was &#8220;aged&#8221; in 1714.  George&#8217;s
movements back and forth between Wethersfield and New London near the time of their marriage
(about 1650 to 1653) suggest that she was from one of these towns.  There appears to have been
some affiliation with William and Mary (--?--) Taylor of Wethersfield and New London.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">William Taylor was granted a house lot at Wethersfield in December 1649, two months after the
birth there of George Chappell&#8217;s last child with wife Christian, and incidentally the last we see of
Christian.
<a href="#WPEndnote333" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote333">333</a>  Within a year, Chappell and Taylor were in New London, where in December 1651
they acquired adjoining lots in the first division.  Taylor had been granted land in the summer of
1650 and had attended a meeting about the town&#8217;s mill that November.  In July 1651, Chappell and
Taylor both &#8220;Wrought in the Mill Dam&#8221;.
<a href="#WPEndnote334" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote334">334</a>  Taylor was still residing there in March 1657/8, but
returned to Wethersfield by June 1660, where he recorded an earmark in November 1661.  Taylor,
however, retained title to his New London property many years after his return to Wethersfield. 
When Chappell, with his wife Margaret&#8217;s consent, sold his lot in September 1673, William Taylor
Sr., &#8220;of Wethersfield&#8221; sold his adjoining lot to the same grantee.
<a href="#WPEndnote335" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote335">335</a>  In the meantime at Wethersfield,
in 1663, William and Mary Taylor had given a daughter the name Margaret.
<a href="#WPEndnote336" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote336">336</a>  Years later, in 1700,
their son John Taylor, then aged about fifty one years, was on hand to witness the marriage in
Wethersfield of George Chappell&#8217;s granddaughter Experience Chappell, baptized at New London
in 1675.  Later still 1728, stating his age as seventy eight years, he testified at her divorce
proceeding.

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: bold">68.  John Beebe</span> (John, #136) was born circa 1600 at Addington, England. He married Rebecca
Ladd, daughter of Robert Ladd, circa 1627 at England; This marriage was noted in Torrey&#8217;s book
even through it took place in England.
<a href="#WPEndnote361" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote361">361</a>  He died, 18 May 1650 (Shipboard Atlantic Ocean

<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">The church register of St. Andrews, in the village of Broughton, Northamptonshire, England, dating
from 1650, verify the names of John Beebe and his children who emigrated to this country about the
year 1650, as stated in his will, on file in Hartford, Connecticut.  They were probably all Puritans and
were known in England as husbandmen or yeomen.  They landed in Boston Harbor, and working
their way westward, were influential in the settlement of New London, Connecticut.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">The name Beebe may have had its origin in two Norman knights who originally spelled the name
de Boebe.  The &#8220;de&#8221; was eventually dropped after coming to England, the name being Anglicized
to its present spelling Beebe.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">From the learned researches of John Thorpe (an old authoritative chronicler and Herald of
Duddeston. Warwickshire, England), we have a clear account of the relation and history of this
family from their ancient home in the Valle de Salve, Normandy, France, up to 1669 in Warwick
County, England, when John Nathaniel and Eli Beebe emigrated to the colonial province of York. 
Ancient family papers in the archives of Aston Hall show that this family descended from the
Norman knights Richard and Guilliaume de Boebe who were of the Royal guard of William the
Conqueror and passed over to England at the time of the conquest and were by the king granted
manors at Bordesley in the county of Warwick, England, where the family lived from the time of the
Norman conquest up to the close of the commonwealth.</p>

another occasion the General Assembly directed that Nathaniel Beebe and certain others
be allowed to take to themselves some guns that were in their possession as part of wages

Nathaniel settled in Stonington, Connecticut.  His land was later absorbed in the large

where the family resided as early as the reign of Henry III (1216-1272, John
Greaves, a descendant, in the reign of Elizabeth (1558-1602), became a purchaser
of &#8220;Beeley,&#8221; a quaint old house with an enclosed court, on the hill above Beeley,

<a href="#WPEndnote406" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote406">406</a>  He married Alice
Lisle, daughter of John Lisle and Alicia Beconsawe.
<a href="#WPEndnote407" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote407">407</a>  He died on 2 April 1704.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">John must have been younger by several years than his brother Thomas, for at his father&#8217;s death in
1638, his apprenticeship, a translation of the record of which is given below, had but half expired. 
If apprenticeships terminated when the apprentice came of age, John Hoar was but eleven years old
when bound to his father.  We see by the records 1633 that John Hoar, son of Charles Hoar of the
city of Gloucester, Brewer, binds himself apprentice to the aforesaid Charles his father and Johanna
his wife by Indenture made on the day of the Feast of St James the Apostle (11 May 1633) in the year
of the reign of King Charles I, now of England etc. the eighth for the term of ten years from the feast
etc. paying at the end of the term six shillings legal money of England.  John appears in Scituate,
Massachusetts, as bearing arms in 1643.  The historian of that town, Samuel Deane, relates that he
was while there resident, always engaged in the business of the town, and in drafting of deeds, bonds,
etc., and is occasionally called a lawyer.  He had lands adjoining Masquashart pond that he sold to
the lawyer John Satlin in 1659, when he removed to Concord.  His ability, vigor and originality of
thought and action soon made him one of the prominent figures in Concord and vicinity, but he is
found often at odds with the ecclesiastical oligarchy of the times.  Whether like his sometime
neighbor at Lancaster, John Prescottto whose son he gave his oldest daughterhe sympathized with
the Presbyterian criticisms of the theocratic restriction of political and religious privileges in the
colony, is not known, but he strongly resembled Prescott in his persistency, enterprise and altruistic
spirit.  He was not only independent in speech, but rashly sharp of tongue and pen, and sutlered
accordingly at the hands of jealous authority.  The story of his disbarment is best told by the original
documents:  He married Alice Lisle, in Concord, Massachusetts.
<a href="#WPEndnote408" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote408">408</a>  John and his brother Leonard
married sisters, the daughters of Lord John and Lady Alice (Becousawe) Lisle, thus making their
children double cousins.
<a href="#WPEndnote409" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote409">409</a>  By Farmer&#8217;s Register we see that John was in Concord in 1660 and his
only son, Daniel was the great grandfather of the Hon. Samuel Hoar.
<a href="#WPEndnote410" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote410">410</a></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">The surname of the family of Hoar originated at the time of the Crusades and may be found spelled
Hore, Hoare and Hoar.  The Family was in early ages of distinction in England.  They held lands in
the 12th Century in South Wales, after its conquest by the Normans.  According to the tradition, and
an old &#8220;Hoar Genealogy,&#8221; the first of the name of Hoar came from Ireland.</p>

It was probably around this time that he had moved to New York.  His daughter our ancestor was
born in New York in 1656.  By 1681 Pennsylvania was founded.  In the year 1692 Joseph and his
family were well away from the Puritans and the witch hunt of Salem and the murder of 20 alleged
witches.  Joseph died in 1718 in Yonkers New York. His daughter Sarah Hadden married George
Clevenger in New York and that is where they both died.</p>

after the expiration of his apprenticeship.Torrey&#8217;s book gives a date of 1612.
<a href="#WPEndnote418" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote418">418</a>  He died circa 1638
at Massachusetts.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">He was the executor of his father&#8217;s will, was probably the eldest son.  He became a man of substance
and one greatly respected in his native city, as is attested by the fact that he was one of its alderman
from 1632-1638 and sheriff in 1634.  His name is found in the Council minutes with &#8220;gentleman&#8221;
or &#8220;generouses&#8221; affixed to it.  In the lists of members of the Council for the sic years before his
decease his name always appears, although generally among Anomina eorum qui fecerunt
defaultum,&#8221; that is, were absent from the meetings.  He followed the occupation of brewer, although
he had served a long apprenticeship with his father the saddler, and his will indicates that he carried
on the business of wool stapling, a trade which early attained great importance in Gloucestershire,
and has been pursued by members of the hoar family there, especially at Cirencester, down to quite
recent days.  The original indenture of this apprenticeship, written in abbreviated Latin is extant of
which the following is a translation.
<a href="#WPEndnote419" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote419">419</a></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">1599.  Charles Hoar son of Charles Hoar of the City of Gloucester, saddler, by act of Indenture made
on the day of the Feast of St. Thomas the Apostle [21 December] in the year of the reign of Queen
Elizabeth the forty first, binds himself apprentice to the said Charles and Margerie, his wife, in the
trade in which the said Charles now practices, for the term of eight years following the feast
aforesaid by act agreed upon verbally on each part.  And the said Charles and Margerie will pay the
said apprentice at the end of the time 40 shillings.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">We find in a petition of John Brown, late mayor, and Charles Hoar and Lawrence Singleton, late
sheriffs of the City of Gloucester, stating that they had collected and paid over to the Treasurer of
the Navy the one thousand pounds ship money imposed upon Gloucester, and asking for the
repayment to them of certain expenses amounting to fifty two pounds, which request was granted.

<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">Of Charles and Joanna&#8217;s children three only are named in his father&#8217;s will: Thomas, Margery and
John; the other three mentioned in his own will: Daniel, Leonard and Joanna, being minors in 1632. 
There may have been others deceased, and probably of these were Ruth, buried June 1628, and
Charles graduated at Oxford 1630, aged 17.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">Charles Hoar, Sr, died circa 1638 at Gloucester, England.  He left a will dated 25 September 1638.
&#8220;Prerogative Court of Canterbury, Doctors Commons, Ad&#8217;ion granted 31 December 1638, to Joane
Hoare the relict.&#8221;  He appears to have left quite a large estate and was a man much engaged in public
affairs.  His widow, with her five children, John, Daniel, Joanna, Leonard and Margerie, came to this
country in 1639/40, and settled in Braintree, Massachusetts.  About this date many families, who
brought much wealth, came to New England.  The cause of this emigration would appear to arise
from the troublesome times in England.  Charles I became king in 1625.  Then came the long
Parliament, and the Civil War began late in 1642.  Charles I was condemned and executed in
London, 30 January 1649.  There is no doubt but that our line at the time of Charles Jr., belonged
to the Parliament side and were strong supporters of the Protestant faith, and this line of the Hoar
family would probably never have had to be recorded if Joanne and her son John had remained in
England.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">The Hincksmen/Henchman family was prosperous and highly esteemed in London and Gloucester.
<a href="#WPEndnote431" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote431">431</a>
Of Joanna&#8217;s immediate family we know only that she had brothers William, Walter, Edward and
Thomas, and sisters Elinor Bailies and (--?--) Founces.  Thomas Hincksman, in 1634 called Alate
servant to Mr. Charles Hoar for the space of eight years now past,&#8221; was then made a burgess, paying
a fine of 10 shillings.  A Walter Hincksman about the same time period was rector at Matlock in
Derbyshire.  The noted Captains Thomas and Daniel Hincksman, who figured in the early Indian
wars in New England, may have been kinsmen of Joanna, though proof of this is lacking at this time. 
That there was some relationship between the early immigrants in New England bearing the names
Hoar and Hincksman seems probable from the frequency with which these names are found
associated.  Capt. Daniel Henchman was one of the witnesses to Fr. Leonard Hoar&#8217;s will, and
Thomas appended his signature as witness to a power of attorney given by Daniel Hoar.

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: bold">150.  John Lisle</span> (William, #300) was circa 1610 of Moyles Court, County Southampton.  On 25
January 1625 he matriculated as a member of Magdalen Hall, Oxford, and graduated B.A. in
February 1625/6.  He first married the daughter of Sir. Henry Hobart, chief justice of the common
pleas.  After her death he then married Alicia Beconsawe/Beckenshaw, the daughter and co heir of
Sir. White Beconsawe/Beckenshaw.
<a href="#WPEndnote433" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote433">433</a>  He was called to the bar from the Middle Temple in 1633
and became the bencher of his inn in 1649.
<a href="#WPEndnote434" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote434">434</a><sup>,</sup>
<a href="#WPEndnote435" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote435">435</a>He was chosen M.P. for Winchester in March
1639/40, and again in October 1640.  He advocated violent measures on the king&#8217;s removal to the
north, and obtained some of the plunder arising from the sale of the crown property.  To the fund
opened on 9 April 1642 for the &#8220;speedy reducing of the rebels&#8221; in Ireland, Lisle contributed 600
pounds.
<a href="#WPEndnote436" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote436">436</a>  In December 1647, when the king was confined in the Isle of Wight, Lisle was selected
as one of the commissioners to carry to him the four bills which were to divest him of all
sovereignty.  He spoke in the House of Commons on 28 September 1648 in favor of rescinding the
recent vote, that no one proposition in regard to the personal treaty with the king should be binding
if the treaty broke off upon another; and again, some days later, urged a discontinuance of the
negotiation with Charles.  He took a prominent part in the king&#8217;s trial.  He was appointed on 8
February 1648/9 one of the commissioners of the great seal, and was placed on the council of state.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">Lisle became one of Cromwell&#8217;s creatures.  He not only concurred in December 1653 in nominating
Cromwell protector, but administered the oath to him; and having been reappointed lord
commissioner, was elected member in the new parliament, on 12 July 1654, both for Southampton,
of which town he was recorder, and for the Isle of Wight.  He selected to sit for Southampton.  In
June previously he had been constituted president of the high court of justice, and in August he was
appointed one of the commissioners of the exchequer.  Lisle alone of his colleagues proposed to
execute the ordinance for the better regulation of the court of chancery, which was submitted to the
keepers of the seal. Owing to his subserviency to Cromwell was continued in his office on the
removal of his colleagues in June 1655.  He was again confirmed in it in October 1656 by
Cromwell&#8217;s third parliament, to which he was re elected by Southampton.  In December 1657
Cromwell summoned Lisle to his newly established house of peers.  Richard Cromwell preserved
him in his place; but when the Long parliament met again in May 1659, he was compelled to retire. 
The house, however, named him on 28 January 1660 a commissioner of the admiralty and navy.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">When the Restoration was inevitable Lisle escaped to Switzerland, establishing himself first at
Vevay, Switzerland and afterwards at Lausanne, where he is said to have &#8220;charmed the Swiss by his
devotion&#8221; and was treated with much respect and ceremony.  There he was shot dead on 11 August
1664 on his way to church  by an Irishman known as Thomas Macdonnell.  Lisle was buried in the
church of the city.</p>

Ellingham, near Ringwood, Hampshire.  The registers at Ellingham are not extant at the period of

<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">The following is taken from the &#8220;<i><span style="text-decoration: underline">Dictionary of National Biography</span></i>:&#8221; William Lilly, the astrologer,
states in his autobiography on page 63, that Mrs. Lisle visited him in 1643 to consult him about the
illness of her friend Sir. Bulstrode Whitelocke.  A note states that at the date of Charles I&#8217;s execution
she was reported to have exclaimed that &#8220;her heart leaped within her to see the tyrant fall;&#8221; but she
herself asserted many years later that she &#8220;shed more tears&#8221; for Charles I&#8217;s than any woman then
living did. (State Trails, xi, p. 360), and she claimed to have been at the time on intimate terms with
the Countess of Monmouth, the Countess of Marlborough, and Edward Hyde, afterwards lord
chancellor.  She probably shared her husband&#8217;s fortunes till his death at Lausanna in 1664. 
Subsequently she lived quietly at Moyles Court, which she inherited from her father, and she showed
while there some sympathy with the dissenting ministers in their trials during Charles II&#8217;s reign.  Her
husband had been a member of Cromwell&#8217;s House of Lords, and she was therefore often spoken of
as Lady or Lady Alice Lisle.  At the time of Monmouth&#8217;s rebellion in the first week of July 1685 she
was in London, but a few days later returned to Moyles Court.  On 20 July she received a message
from John Hickes the dissenting minister, asking her to shelter him.  Hickes had taken part in
Monmouth&#8217;s behalf at the battle of Sedgemoor (6 July) and was flying from justice.  But, according
to her own account, Mrs. Lisle merely knew him as a prominent dissenting minister, and imagined
that a warrant was out against him for illegal preaching or for some offence committed in his
ministerial capacity.  She readily consented to receive him, and he arrived at ten o&#8217;clock at night, a
few days later, accompanied by the messenger Dunne, and by one Richard Nelthorp, another of
Monmouth&#8217;s supporters, of whom Mrs. Lisle knew nothing.  There arrival was at once disclosed by
a spying villager to Colonel Penruddock, who arrived next day (26 July) with a troop of soldiers, and
arrested Mrs. Lisle and her guests.  Mrs. Lisle gave very confused answers to the colonel, whose
father, John Penruddock, a well known royalist, had been sentenced to death by her husband.  On
27 August 1685 she was tried by special commission before Judge Jeffreys at Winchester on the
capital charge of harbouring Hickes as a traitor.  No evidence respecting Hickes&#8217;s offences was
admitted, and in spite of the brutal browbeating by the judge of chief witness, Dunne, no proof was
adduced wither that Mrs. Lisle had any ground to suspect Hickes of disloyalty or that she had
displayed any sympathy with Monmouth&#8217;s insurrection.  She made a moderate speech in her own
defence.  The jury declared themselves reluctant to convict her, but Jeffreys overruled their scruples,
and she was ultimately found guilty, and on the morning of the next day(28 Aug.) she was sentenced
to be burnt alive the same afternoon.  Pressure was, however, applied to the judge, and a respite till
2 Sept. was ordered.  Lady Lisle petitioned James II (31 Aug) to grant her a further reprieve of four
days, and to order the substitution of beheading for burning.  The first request was refused; the latter
was granted.  Mrs. Lisle was accordingly beheaded in the market place of Winchester on 2 Sept., and
her body was given up to her friends for burial at Ellingham.  On the scaffold she gave a paper to the
sheriffs denying her guilt, and it was printed, with the &#8220;Last Words of Colonel Rumbold,&#8221; 1685, and
in &#8220;The Dying Speeches...of several Persons,&#8221; 1689.  The first pamphlet was also published in
Dutch.  The attainder was reversed by a private act of parliament in 1689 at the request of Mrs.
Lisle&#8217;s two married daughters, Triphena Lloyd and Bridget Usher, on the ground that &#8220;the verdict
was in juriously extorted and procured by the menances and violence and other illegal practices: of
Jeffreys&#8221;.  The daughter Triphena Lloyd married, at a later date, a second husband named Grove, and
her daughter became with wife of Lord James Russell, fifth son of William Russell, first duke of
Bedford.  Bridget Lisle also married twice; her first husband being Leonard Hoare, president of
Harvard University, and her second Hezekiah Usher of Boston, Massachusetts.</p>

<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">With Charles Hoar, Sr., the pedigree of the American branch of the family begins.  Perhaps the
earliest recorded mention of him may be the item in the corporation expenditures when the Spanish
Armada was menacing England, 1588: &#8220;To Charles Hoare for heir of a horse for two days which
Roger Lowe had to Cirencester when he went to bring the soldiers towards portingate.&#8221;  A book,
prepared by John Smythe of Nibley for Lord Berkeley, &#8220;containing the names and surnames of all
able and efficient men in body for his Majesty&#8217;s service in the wars in the County of Gloucester, with
their ages, Personable statures and armours etc.,&#8221; by the Right Honorable Lieutenant Lord Berkeley,
Lord Lieutenant, etc., by direction from his Majesty in August 1608, gives the following account of
Charles and Richard Hoare.
<a href="#WPEndnote443" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote443">443</a></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>Richard Hoar, Weaver, 3 p. tr.  Hath a corslet furnished.&#8221;</i></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">The figures and abbreviations appended to the names give the personal description.  Thus Charles
Hoare was about forty years of age, somewhat short of stature, suitable for service with a calvary,
and already trained as a soldier.  Richard Hoare was between fifty and sixty years of age, of the
tallest stature, fitted for a pikeman, and trained in military service.
<a href="#WPEndnote444" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote444">444</a></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">The Surname of the family of Hoare, originated at the time of the Crusades.  The Family was in early
ages of distinction in England.  They held lands in the 12th Century in South Wales, after its
conquest by the Normans.  According to the tradition, and an old genealogy, the first of the name
(Hoar) came from Charles Hoar, of Gloucester, England.  He appears to have been a person of note
in that place.  The &#8220;coat of arms&#8221; of the &#8220;Hoare Family&#8221; were used by the Gloucester family.</p>

Occupation: Baron.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: bold">Please Note:  </span>Unless otherwise stated in a footnote all Hungerford research by Peter Sherlock, based
on the notes of the Rev. Jackson, chaplain of Farleigh Hungerford. Information made available
through the courtesy of the Hungerford Family Association Society.  </p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sir. Walter (later Lord Walter) strongly supported the Lancastrian cause at the close of the reign of
Richard II, last of the Plantagenet rulers.  Upon the accession of Henry IV in 1399, first of the
Lancastrian kings, he was knighted and granted 100 pounds per year, to be taken out of the lands of
Margaret, Duchess of Norfolk, in consideration of his eminent services.  He was taken prisoner by
rebels during the 1400 uprising against the new king, but was accused of disloyalty for allegedly
stealing gold  jewels and saddles from William Tanner.  However, having proved his innocence and
loyalty, he again became the King&#8217;s Knight.  In October 1406 he was appointed Chamberlain of the
Princess Phillipa and accompanied her to Denmark when she was married to King Eric.  He was with
the English army in the wars with France (The Hundred Years War) and acquired great honor at
Calais in 1406 where he bested a knight of France (or the King of France) in a duel.  For his honors
and expenses, he was granted 100 marks per year payable out of the town and castle of
Marleborough in Wiltshire County, where he was appointed Sheriff.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">In the 13th Henry IV (1412), at the death of his mother Joan, he inherited the manors of Heytesbury
and Teffont Evias, Wiltshire County, Farleigh and others in Somerset County.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">In the 2nd Henry V (1414) he was appointed ambassador to Sigismund, the Holy Roman Emperor
and King of Hungary. Sigismund, successor to King Wenceslaus IV, crowned Vlad, Prince of
Wallachia, whose family is now well known as that of Count Dracula.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">The next year he was with Henry V with 20 men at arms and 60 house archers at Agincourt.  It is
reported that Sir. Walter, not the Earl of Westmoreland, was the officer who expressed regret that
the English did not have 10,000 archers, drawing the famous rebuke from the King recorded by
Shakespeare (Henry V, Act IV, Scene iii):</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center">"No, my fair cousin;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">If we are marked to die, we are enough</p>
<p style="text-align: center">To do our country loss; and if to live</p>
<p style="text-align: center">The fewer men, the greater share of honor.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">God&#8217;s will! I pray thee, wish not one man more."</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">In the 4th Henry V (1417), Sir. Walter was appointed Admiral of the Fleet under John, Duke of
Bedford.  For the next few years he was steward of the King&#8217;s household and entirely engaged in the
Wars.  He was in the King&#8217;s service at the Siege of Roan. After which he obtained a grant of the
Barony of Homet in Normandy, formerly enjoyed by Sir. William de Montney.  For this honor, Lord
Walter yearly rendered to the King and his heirs one lance with a fox tail hanging thereat upon the
feast day of the exaltation of the Holy Cross, and provided ten men at arms and twenty archers to
serve the King or his lieutenant in the wars.  Continuing to acquire fresh laurels on French soil, this
gallant soldier obtained as a further grant for his services, the castle of Neville and territory of Breant
in Normandy, with diverse other lands which had been the possessions of Sir. Robert de Breant.  In
the 8th Henry V (1421) he was installed as a Knight of the Garter.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">In 1422, Lord Walter was an executor of the will of Henry V, and on the advice of Parliament, was
appointed steward of the infant King Henry VI.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">Further to Lord Walter&#8217;s role as executor of the will of Henry V, Richard Hungerford, North
American representative for the Hungerford and Associated Families Society has contributed the
following:  "Walter 1st Lord Hungerford, Speaker to Parliament and Ambassador to the Council of
Constance, fought at Agincourt, was treasurer to Henry VI, and was an executor of the will of Henry
V."</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">A scholarly discussion (and copy of) the will can be found on page 79 of the January 1981 issue of
"English Historical Review." The text of the will was in Latinit was not translated by the author of
the article (he assumed you could read it)so I asked a priest at the college I attended to translate
portions of the text where the name Hungerford was present.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">The priest, Rev. Joseph Costillo, said the following about his attempts to read the passages.  "The
problem with these texts is that they were written by lawyers who have a stake in arcane, an archaic
language.  They get paid for writing the unintelligible, and get paid again for deciphering it."</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">Here are the passages he translated for me:</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in"><i>"Likewise we leave to Robert, Lord of Willoughby a golden cup.  Likewise we
leave to Walter Hungerford, the procurator for our home a golden chalice."</i></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">(Earlier in the sentence:  "We name, create, and delegate as executors of this will of our king) Walter
Hungerford, procurator of our home of Willoughby, Walter Beauchamp, the treasurer of our home,
Luis Robessarat, William Porter, Robert Babthorp, the bookkeeper of our house, privates John
Wodehouse, John Leventhorp, and John Wilcotes armorers.  Among those whom we have appointed
to be our executors and administrators are Henry, Lord of Fitz Hugh, Walter Hungerford, Walter
Beauchamp, Louis Robessart, William Porter, and Robert Babthorp, privates, and also (John)
Wodehouse, John  Leventhorp and John Wilcotes, already mentioned, whom we wish to immediately
appoint for the execution of this our last will and to be continuously diligent until each and
everything in this our will has been accomplished."</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in"><i>"We also wish that with respect to his person and in his home he should be
assisted by our beloved and faithful chamberlain, and by Walter Hungerford, our
procurator, one of who we wish to be always with him.  We also wish that all our
books, of whatever kind or material that are not mentioned in our will or (its)
appendices should remain with our son for his library."</i></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sir. Walter, Lord Homet, was installed in the House of Lords, the Upper House of Parliament in the
4th Henry VI as the first Baron Hungerford by Writ of Summons, 7 January 1426.  The Parliament,
held at Leicester, was known as the "Parliament of Bats,&#8221; and during it Lord Hungerford was
appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer.  Lord Walter became constable of Windsor Castle, and in
the 6th of Henry VI, he gave diverse houses and shops in the parish of St. Anthony in London to the
Free Royal Chapel of St. Stephen in the palace at Westminster.  In consideration of this grant, they
covenanted to make him partaker of all their masses and suffrages during his lifetime, and to
celebrate his death annually with "Placebo,&#8221; "Dirige,&#8221; and a mass of "Requiem.&#8221;  At the mass they
were to distribute certain allotments to each churchman.  In the 9th Henry VI (1431) his Lordship
had licence to transport 3000 marks for the ransom of his son Walter, then a prisoner in France.  In
the 24th Henry VI (1446) he was granted the town and manor of Hungerford.  Lord Walter remained
in Parliament until his death in the 27th Henry VI (1449).</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sir. Walter, Lord Hungerford of Heytesbury, Knight of the Garter, Baron Hungerford and Homet,
Treasurer of Englanddirected that he be buried with his first wife, Catherine, in a certain chapel in
the Cathedral Church at Salisbury, in which he had founded a perpetual chantry for two chaplains. 
After some pious bequests, his Testament, dated 1 July 1449, left various properties, gifts and
bequests to his family, his second wife Eleanor, Countess Arundel, his sons Sir. Robert Lord
Hungerford and Sir. Edmund, his daughters Elizabeth and Margaret, Lady Margaret, wife of Lord 
Robert, and his grandsons Sir Robert Lord Moleyns, Arnolph, and William.  Because his much
honored Lord Viscount Beaumont was lineally descended from the Dukes of Lancaster, he
bequeathed him a cup of silver with a cover bordered in gold.  From this cup the most noble Prince
John, son of Henry VI, Duke of Lancaster, was often served.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">Heytesbury is a Wiltshire village that lies in the lovely Wylye Valley.  The Hospital of St. John the
Baptist and St. Katherine of the Hungerford Almshouse was founded in 1449 by Sir. Walter, first
Lord Hungerford, and completed by his daughter in law Margaret Botreaux Hungerford.  The
original structure was burned in the great fire of 1765 that nearly destroyed the entire town of
Heytesbury, and has been replaced by a modern hospital and apartments.  The hospital continues to
carry on the works assigned in the 15th century.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.75in">[From Richard HungerfordHAFS]Sir Walter was part of an English army that met, and
was overwhelmed by, a French army led by (amongst others) Joan of Arc.  The English
didn&#8217;t realize how close they were to the main body of French. They had stopped and had
begun to make preparations for contact by doing things such as setting up the stakes and
hammering them into the ground (shades of Agincourt).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.75in">To make a long story short, the French (uncharacteristically) charged straight ahead
through the surprised ranks of Fastolf&#8217;s English archers, caused a rout of that force into
Talbot&#8217;s group, forcing all who weren&#8217;t killed to surrender. Up to this point, the French
had approached most English positions "with circumspection, even trepidation."  The
theory is that Joan of Arc inspired the troops to be aggressive.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: bold">154112.  Thomas Hungerford</span> (Walter, #308224) was born circa 1300.  He first married Eleanor
Strug.  Eleanor&#8217;s occupation was Heiress and she died before 1376.  After the death of Eleanor he
then married Joan Hussey, circa 1377.  Sir. Thomas died on 3 December 1398.  He was buried on
5 December 1398 at Farleigh, Somerset, England.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: bold">Please Note:</span>Unless otherwise stated all Hungerford research by Peter Sherlock, based on the notes
of the Rev. Jackson, chaplain of Farleigh Hungerford. Information made available through the
courtesy of the Hungerford Family Association Society.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sir Thomas acquired his first offices in the 28th Edward III (1355) as sheriff and escheat or for
Wiltshire.  He was closely associated with John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, whose rivalry with
Edward the Black Prince, his brother, for the throne of England is so well known. He served as
steward of the household of John of Gaunt, and was bailiff for the Bishop of Salisbury. In the 42nd
Edward III (1369) he purchased the manor Farleigh Montfort in Somerset from Lord Berghersh for
1100 marks.  In January of the 50th Edward III (1377) Sir Thomas was knighted and chosen to fill
the chair as Speaker of the House of Commons, the first person formally mentioned in the rolls of
Parliament as holding that high office.  This Parliament, called "The Bad Parliament" was controlled
by John of Gaunt to serve Lancastrian interests.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">Sir Thomas continued to build the holdings of the family, an expansion which was remarkable, for
in about 100 years, the ownership of land by this family increased from not a single manor in 1355
to nearly 200 manors by 1460.  In the 3rd Richard II (1380) he obtained confirmation to the office
of Forester of Selwoon, acquired from Roger of Sturton.  Three years later he obtained permission
to crenelate Farleigh, thereby converting his manor to a castle. He purchased the manor of
Heytesbury, called West Court, with the Hundred of Heytesbury, from Elizabeth, widow of Edward,
Lord Spencer.  A "hundred" was a unit of land for the enforcement of justice and defense of the
realm.  It consisted of one hundred "hides,&#8221; a "hide" being the amount of land that could be tilled
annually by a single plow. </p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">The next year he fortified, without licence, his manor house at Farleigh, thereby arousing the
suspicions of Richard II, Gaunt&#8217;s nephew.  To reduce the power of the landholding Barons, royal
assent was required prior to the fortification of the new, more comfortable brick manor houses that
had come into style as homes for the landed gentry. Edward III allowed 181 such fortifications, but
as succeeding kings sought to assure their position, approval was more difficult to obtain. Richard
II allowed but 60 fortifications, Henry IV allowed 8 and Henry V, only 1.  Sir Thomas was charged
with treason at Salisbury. However, he was pardoned, fined, and soon afterward procured a charter
for  free title to all his estates.  He died in the last year of Richard II&#8217;s reign, only one son surviving
him, and is buried in the Chapel of St. Anne at Farleigh.  The portrait in stained glass in that chapel
is reportedly of him.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">Farleigh Hungerford is a River From village where remains of the medieval castle contain the
monuments of the Hungerford family.  Originally the site of the Montfort family manor, the property
was sold to the de Burghersh family in 1348.  The chapel was originally the parish church of St.
Leonard.  As reported above, Thomas Hungerford purchased the manor in 1369, and fortified it as
a castle in 1384.  The Chapel of St. Anne was added in the 1380&#8217;s to provide burial space for the
Hungerford&#8217;s.  From here, the vast holdings of the family extended to every horizon.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">The castle remained in the family for nearly 300 years, although at times it was seized by the crown
and placed under other ownership during the attainder of various Hungerford&#8217;s. Sir Edward, "the
Spendthrift" eventually sold Farleigh to Henry Boynton in 1686.  The manor was sold to J. Long and
others to be held in trust for one thousand years; James Barber, Robert Houlton, and Edward Grant
were the other trustees.  The Houlton family of Trowbridge obtained sole title to the castle in 1730
when Lady Clotworthy released it from the trusteeship. Lord Donington and his wife, the Baroness
Hungerford, purchased the property in 1891, held it only briefly before selling it to Lord Cairns, who
placed it in the trust of the government in 1915.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Sir. Walter, like his elder brother, represented Wiltshire in Parliaments from 1331 through 1336, and
held several minor offices in local government.  He was finally replaced as coroner in the 19th
Edward III (1346) since he was too feeble to carry out his duties.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">The early Hungerford family had no coat of arms, but used the sickle as their symbol.  Usually the
emblem consisted of three sickles formed into a triangular knot.  This device may still be seen on
the archway at Farleigh Hungerford and in other places.  The family burial monuments in Salisbury
Cathedral and elsewhere are frequently marked with a large number of individual sickles.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">When the first Lord Walter was officially granted a coat of arms, it contained several elements that
indicate the origins of the family holdings.  The familiar black shield divided by two silver bars and
adorned with three silver coins was originally the device awarded the Fitz John family and inherited
through Sir.Walter&#8217;s marriage.  The crest consists of a golden sheaf of wheat, a garb, indicating the
Peverell marriage and the inheritance of that Lord Walter.  The garb, bracketed by two silver sickles,
is the familiar Hungerford emblem.</p>

the first year of the reign of King Edward III (1327), Sir. Robert was appointed
commissioner to certify to the Barons of the Exchecquer the possession, lands and
tenements of Hung Despenser, Earl of Winchester and his son Hugh who, with others,
was killed in the last year of the reign of Edward II.  In the 3rd Edward III (1329) he was
appointed to survey the dilapidation of Old Sarum Castle, the Roman name for Salisbury. 
He served as steward to Ralph of Shrewsbury, Bishop of Bath and Wells.  Through his
marriage, he acquired several manors and began to establish the family position in
Wiltshire.  Sir. Robert, distinguished by his piety, gave lands of great value to the
wardens of the hospital of St. John at Clne to maintain a priest to pray for the soul of his
wife, for the health of his own soul, and the souls of his parents, benefactors and all the
faithful.  If this trust were not fulfilled, the lands were to devolve upon his younger
brother and heir, Sir. Walter.  He died 20 June 1352 at Hungerford, Berkshire, England.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: bold">4915200.  Jordan de Insula</span> was born circa 1100.  He lived in the time of king Henry I and King
Stephen (1100-1154). He married Hawise (--?--).</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">The history of the family is taken from Mrs. Rixford book:
<a href="#WPEndnote633" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote633">633</a>A few miles to the southwest of the city
of Glasgow, in Scotland, lies the old barony of Lyle, or Duchal.  In this barony stood Duchal Castle,
the home for several centuries of the Lords Lyle.  When the castle was built is not known, but in
1170, in a grant to the monks of Paisley, appears the signature of &#8220;Radulphus de Insula, Dominus
de Duchal.&#8221;  A date so early as 1057 has had mention.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">From a book, &#8220;Much About Kilmalcolm,&#8221; is taken an extract as follows:</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in"><i>&#8220;The great barony of Duchal, which for many ages was the chief property and
place of residence of the ancient family of Lyle, was of great extent situated in the
heart of the Parish on both sides of the Gryffe, but chiefly inland from it.  The first
mention of the family of Lyle (who are said to have been originally a West
Highland family, and to derive their name from L&#8217;isle) occurs in the grant, etc.&#8221;</i></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">In the same book Appears:</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in"><i>&#8220;An eminent local antiquary holds that the castle (Duchal), surrounded on three
sides by the stream, and the fourth by a fosse, which was crossed a draw bridge,
is the Insula meant and that they took their name from the Island on which the fort
was built.&#8221;</i></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">In an old work in Edinburgh Library appears:</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in"><i>&#8220;The river Gryffe hath its rise in the moor and parish of Kilmalcolm, at the head
of which stands the old castle and fort of Duchall, the ancient inheritance of the
Barons Lyll of Douchalle, made Lords of Parliament by King James III, failed in
the Reign of Queen Mary in the person of James, last Lord Lyle, who was dead
about 1550.&#8221;</i></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">The remains of Duchal Castle were described in 1792 &#8220;as very romantic in situation and strong in
construction.&#8221;  Says the Imperial Gazetteer of Scotland:</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.6in; margin-right: 0.6in"><i>&#8220;The remains of the strong and romantic Duchal Castle stand upon the
confluence of the Duchal with another rivulet.  In 1710, a mansion was built
about a mile east of this.  The present (1848) mansion house was built in 1768. 
It stands on the right bank of the Gryffe and is well sheltered with woods.&#8221;</i></p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">At one time the castle was besieged.  At this time the ruins are little distinguishable.  In the nearby
town of Kilmalcom and Kilbarchan there are many of the Lyle name at this time.  A small settlement
was called Lylesland.  Duchal is pronounced Duck all.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">The surname of Lisle, L&#8217;isle, Lyle,or de Insula, was first assumed by the proprietors of some of the
Western Isles in the reign of Malcolm Canmore. They had also possessions in the County of
Renfrew, where Duchal Castel was their principal seat.  From a letter written by William Robertson,
the author of &#8220;Historical Tales and Legends of Ayrshire,&#8221; the following extract is taken: &#8220;The Lyles&#8221;
are a very old family.  Old enough to have a wraith.  That is, a duplicate of the head of the house who
came to warn some relative that the master, or Lord, was about to die.  The ballad, &#8220;Lord Lyle,&#8221; is
founded on Ayrshire traditions.

<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">Nicholas, whose parentage is unknown, appears to have been from an early age in the court of King
John, and was an official actively employed in the King&#8217;s service both in embassies and the field.
In 1217 the manor of Watlington was granted to him "for his sustenance in the king&#8217;s service," and
similar gifts followed. In April 1223, he was sent to Poitou on an embassy from the King, and again
in the following January. In the summer of 1223 he served in the King&#8217;s expedition into Wales, and
in the following year at the siege of Bedford. In January 1224/5 he was one of the ambassadors sent.
to Cologne to treat of a proposed marriage between Henry III and a daughter of Leopold VI, Duke
of Austria. In July 1226 the land of Little Berkhampstead was granted to him, and this and other
estates were later confirmed in fee. He also, by his marriage with a wealthy heiress, Hawise, one of
the daughters and heirs of James de Newmarch, acquired Cadbury and other manors in Somerset and
the neighboring counties, thus becoming one of the greater landowners. In 1227 he was in Gascony
on the King&#8217;s service, and a joint ambassador to the Count of Flanders; in March 1228 was charged
with negotiations as to the truce with France, and in November of that year, at Westminster,
witnessed Henry&#8217;s grant to the Bishop of Chichester of land in." New Street," now the site of
Lincoln&#8217;s Inn. In April of the following year, as miles noster familiaris, he was a plenipotentiary to
treat of peace with Louis IX of France, and was again going to Gascony in the King&#8217;s service. He
was sheriff of Hants and custos of Winchester Castle from July 1228 to March 1231/2, sheriff of
Devon, 1234 1236, of York, Easter 1239 to Michaelma 1241, and of Kent, March to October 1258.
He was granted the custody of the Channel Islands in 1234, and was keeper the bishopric of Durham
during part of the vacancy after the translation of Bishop Richard le Poer, 1237. At the Coronation
of Queen EIeanor, in 1236, he and Richard Siward, milites strenui, carried the two royal sceptres.
In 1242 he was ambassador to the King of France with Ralph FitzNicholas, and later in the year
joined the English King in Bordeaux. In September 1243 Henry III, returning to England, left
Nicholas de Moels as seneschal of Gascony. In the following year he inflicted a defcat on the King
of Navarre. In 1245 he was appointed keeper of the castles of Cardigan and Carmarthen, and in the
same year was constable of Pembroke, Haverford, Kilgarran and Tenby. In 1246 and 1247 he was
in the wars of Wales and was seneschal of Carmarthen, and in February 1248/9 was added to the
commissioners to deal with the King of Navarre. As "Nicholas de Molis, king&#8217;s clerk," he had a
grant of free warren in his demesne lands in Cadbury and Mapperton in January 1250/1. On 16 June
1252 he was sent into Gascony with Roscelin de Fos, Master of the Templars in England, as
conservator of the truce between Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, and Gaston, Viscount de
Bearn. He was engaged in Wales in connection with Henry&#8217;s futile expedition in 1257, and in 1263
received his last military summons to the muster at Hereford against Llewelyn. In January 1257/8
he was appointed constable of Dover Castle and Warden of the Cinque Ports. He was constable of
the castles of Rochester, Canterbury, and Winchester in 1258, of Sherborne in 1261, and of Corfe
in 1263, and one of the King&#8217;s serjeants in Windsor Castle 1263 64. He was on the King&#8217;s side in
the Barons&#8217; War, and was ordered, 4 July 1264, to deliver Windsor Castle to John, son of John, the
custodian appointed by the Barons.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: bold">Comment on Source Reference Notes:</span>  Renaud de Courtenay, Lord of Courtenay; accompanied
Louis VII of France on the Second Crusade but quarreled with him so that Louis seized his French
possessions and bestowed them, with Renaud&#8217;s daughter (Elizabeth) in marriage, on his (Louis&#8217;)
own younger brother Pierre; Renaud subsequently threw in his lot with the English kings and was
granted the Lordship of Sutton (now Sutton Courtenay), on the Berks Oxon borders by Henry II
1161; accompanied Henry II to Wexford in the Irish expedition of 1172; married 1st Hedwige (living
1148 58), sister of Guy du Donjon; married 2nd Maud, Dame du Sap (dsp 1224), daughter of Robert
Fitz Roy (illegitimate son of Henry I of England) by his wife Maud d&#8217;Avranches. [Burke&#8217;s Peerage]</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">The chart in G. E. Cokycane&#8217;s Peerage ... IV: 317 agrees with Burke&#8217;s Peerage above (with Renaud
having Reginald, d. 1194, by the sister of Guy du Donjon). However, following Ancestral Roots 7,
I consider there to be two Renaud de Courtenay&#8217;s: Renaud I married Hedwige du Donjon and his
son, Renaud II married 1st Hawise Deincourt (by whom they had Reginald, d. 1194) and 2nd Maud
du Sap (dsp 1224). I believe that chronologically it works much better, and solves many of the
problems (according to Ancestral Roots7  see notes under Miles/Milo de Courtenay) with the line
given by George Edward Cokycane, Complete Peerage and Berk&#8217;s, Peerage. There is evidence of
two different Renaud de Courtenays, one who died 1161, and one who d. 1190 (Ancestral Roots) or
1192 (Burke, Peerage). See notes under son Renaud.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">Renaud de Courtenay [son of Miles/Milo de Courtenay &amp; Ermengard de Nevers], Sire de Courtenay,
d. 1161; married a daughter of Frederick (or Guy) du Donjon and Corbeil. [Ancestral Roots, Line
#107, person #24]</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">The story is told that the great possessions in France of Renaud de Courtenay (a man of high social
rank and described in personal terms as in effect a glorified bandit) were seized abt 1150 by King
Louis VII who granted them to his own youngest brother, Pierre (ancestor of the French Courtenays),
with Renaud&#8217;s daughter, Elizabeth, in marriage, and that Renaud then appeared in England as a
minor functionary of the English Court with a small manor and another family. [Ancestral Roots,
line 138 23 (see notes under Miles de Courtenay)]</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">Ancestral Roots also discounts Renaud, d. 1190, being the same person as Renaud, d. 1161, son of
Milo because of dates and social standings, but does not seem to address the possibility him being
a grandson (ie. of Renaud/Reginald II (d. 1190, Line #138, person #24), son of Renaud/Reginald I
(d. 1161, Line #107, person #24), son of Milo [d. 1127, Ancestral Roots, Line #107, person #23)).</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">Since according to Burke, Elizabeth&#8217;s marriage was 1150, Renaud lost his French lands and went
to England on or about 1150. His children were born in France, while he still had possession of his
French estates.</p>

Richard was made an Earl of Devon.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: bold">Please Note:</span>  From the work of George Edward Cokayne&#8217;s book Complete Peerage IV: 309-11 we
find the following: &#8220;Richard de Reviers, Seigneur de Reviers, Vernon, and N&eacute;hou, in Normandy. His
parentage is unknown, but he has been conjectured to have been the son and heir of William de
Vernon(a). In Domesday he appears as the possessor of a single Manor Mosterton in Dorset. It has
been erroneously considered that he was created Earl of Devon by Henry, I. The authorities for this
are the statements made in two monastic chronicles. There is, however, abundant charter evidence
that he never styled himself an Earl, that his wife in her widowhood never styled herself a Countess,
and that none of their children, nor their grandchildren, ever so styled them. He was the founder (in
the technical sense of the word) of the Abbey of Montebourg. ~ He married Adelise, daughter of
William Peverell of Nottingham, the elder, by Adeline, his wife. He died 8 September 1107, and was
buried in the Abbey of Montebourg. His widow survived her eldest son, Baldwin, and died 27 May
1156 or later. ~  (a) It appears from a charter of Henry I to the canons of Breamore that Richard&#8217;s
son, Baldwin had an uncle Hugh, who (if by &#8216;Avunnculus&#8217; is meant &#8216;patruus&#8217;) may be the Hugh de
Redveris mentioned in a memorandum of La Trinite at Caen, and also the Hugh mentioned as son
of William de Vernon in a document (of date about 1067) in the cartulary of La Trinite at Rouen,
signed by William Vernonensis and Emma his wife. In the register of Carisbrooke it is said that
Richard de Reviers was &#8216;nepos&#8217; of William Fitz Osborn, after whose death (his sons John &amp; Richard
having dvp.) the Isle of Wight was inherited by the said Richard, &#8216;tunc Comes Exonie.&#8217; So that this
Richard may have been son of William de Vernon, by Emma, sister of William fitz Osborn. The
continuator of William of Jumieges states that a niece of Gunnor the wife of Duke Richard was
married to Osmund de Centumvillis, Vicomte de Vernon, and was mother of the first Fulk de Aneio
and of the mother of the first Baldwin de Reviers.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-weight: bold">Comment on Source Reference Notes: </span> In Ezra Cleveland&#8217;s &#8220;A Genealogical History of the Noble
and Illustrious Family of Courtenay,&#8221; (1735), pp. 114-115, is identified as Reginald de Courtenay.
The story is told that the great possessions in France of Renaud (a.k.a. Reginald) de Courtenay (a
man of high social rank and described in personal terms as in effect a glorified bandit) were seized
about 1150 by King Louis VII who granted them to his youngest brother, Pierre (ancestor of the
French Courtenays), with Renaud&#8217;s daughter, in marriage, and that Renaud then appeared in England
as a minor functionary of the English Court with a small manor and another family. Line breaks here.
Although Old CP III:102 states that the alleged connection between the English and French families
has not been established, Cokayne&#8217;s Peerage IV:317 inexplicably revived the connection. Herbert
F. Seversmith, &#8220;The Ancestry of Roger Ludlow&#8221;, pp. 2419-2424, in addition to demonstrating the
lack of contemporary evidence, points out the chronological, personal character, and social status
difficulties with this identification. [Ancestral Roots, line #138, person #23]</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">It is my belief that on the stated sources that Renaud de Courtenay, the stated (Weis&#8217; source Line
#107, person #24) son of Miles &amp; Ermengarde, was father of Renaud de Courtenay (Weis&#8217; Line
#138, person # 24), who was the purported son in this broken line. Making the purported son the
grandson (being Renaud son of Renaud) solves the chronological problems (and maybe the social
problems) stated above. The social problems are solved, in that Miles de Courtenay&#8217;s son Renaud
lost all his "powerful" possessions in 1150, and we find Renaud&#8217;s son Renaud, born circa 1125 (see
notes under Miles&#8217; grandson, Renaud son of Renaud), accompanying the King as some sort of
"secretary" and receiving some lands from the King (ie. starting out all over again in England). This
line entails three Renauds in a row, while I think that Cokayne, Peerage, Ancestral Roots, and other
sources try to do it in two.</p>

<a href="#WPEndnote738" id="LinkTo_WPEndnote738">738</a>  Earldom of Surrey I, 1088. William de Warenne was 1st son
of Rodulf II by Emma. At some time in or after 1054 Duke William gave him the castle of
Mortemer, which had been forfeited by his kinsman, Roger de Mortimer, after the Battle of
Mortemer in February of that year. Probably at the same time he acquired lands at Bellencombre, the
castle of which became the caput of the Warenne barony in Normandy. In 1066 he was one of the
Norman barons summoned by the Duke to a Council on hearing that Harold had been crowned King
after the death of the Confessor. He took part in the invasion of England and was present at the Battle
of Hastings.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">He married, 1stly, Gundred, sister of Gerbod the Fleming, Earl of Chester, possibly daughter of
Gerbod, hereditary advocate of the Abbey of St. Bertin at St. Omer. She died in child birth, 27 May
1085, at Castle Acre, Norfolk, and was buried the chapter house at Lewes. He married, 2ndly, [----],
sister of Richard Guet (living 1098). He died 24 June 1088, apparently from the effect of his wound
at Pevensey, at Lewes, and was buried there beside his wife.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">The following is taken from "The Origins of Some Anglo Norman Families.&#8221;For this identification
see Mr. Loyd&#8217;s paper &#8216;The Origin of the Family of Warenne&#8217; in Yorkshire Arch. Journal, vol. xxxi,
pp. 97-113. The hamlet of Varenne lies on the river Varenne circa 2 miles South of Arques and about
13 miles N of Bellencombre. The latter place, arr. Dieppe, cant. Bellencombre, where there was a
castle, became the caput of the Warenne honour in Normandy.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">William Warenne was one of those followers of William of Normandy who made their fortunes by
the conquest of England. The younger son of Rudulf of Varenne in Normandy, he distinguished
himself in ducal service as a very young man in the early 1050s. After the ducal victory at Mortemer
(1054) he received estates in upper Normandy, but it was only after the English invasion that he
attained the front rank. He fought at Hastings and was rewarded with lands which by 1086 extended
into thirteen counties, most notably strategically important estates in Sussex centered round Lewes.
By the end of William I&#8217;s reign he was one of the dozen largest individual landowners in England.
He repaid his debt with vigorous loyalty in both England and France. In 1075 he played a leading
role in suppressing the revolt of the earls of Hereford and Norfolk. After the Conqueror&#8217;s death,
Warenne supported William Rufus in 1087/88 against Robert Curthose and Odo of Bayeux. Rufus
encouraged his service by creating him earl of Surrey in 1088. The same year Warenne was seriously
wounded by an arrow in his leg at the siege of Pevensey and died at his foundation of Lewes Priory
on 24 June 1088.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">Warenne&#8217;s career was more than meteoric. A younger son of an obscure minor Norman nobleman,
he had risen through conspicuous loyalty to his lord to become not only one of the richest men in one
of the richest kingdoms of Europe but also the founder of a dynasty which, powerful, wealthy and
influential, survived as earl of Surrey until 1347. Warenne&#8217;s foundation at Lewes (1078/80) was the
first Cluniac house in England, another sign of the Conquest&#8217;s effect on establishing institutional as
well as personal links across the Channel. Warenne&#8217;s success depended on the traditional chivalric
virtues of loyalty, bravery and prowess in arms. His life illustrates the stupendous prizes and the
personal dangers on offer to those who joined the conquest of England. It was appropriate that
Warenne&#8217;s direct descendent, John De Warenne, Earl of Surrey (1231-1304), when challenged in
1278 by royal commissioners to produce title to his land, produced an old rusty sword declaring,
&#8216;Here, my Lord, is my warrant (warrantus: a pun which no doubt appealed to the somewhat
intractable sense of honour of the time). My ancestors came with William the Bastard and won their
lands with the sword, and by the sword I will hold them against all comers.&#8217; Earl John won his case.
William of Warenne would have approved. [Christopher Tyerman, &#8220;Who&#8217;s Who in Early Medieval
England,&#8221; Shepheard Walwyn, Ltd., London, 1996]</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">William de Warrenne, Earl of Warrenne, in Normandy, a near kinsman of William the Conqueror,
came into England with that prince and, having distinguished himself at the battle of Hastings,
obtained an immense portion of the public spoliation. He had large grants of land in several counties,
amongst which were the Barony of Lewes, in Sussex, and the manors of Carletune and Benington,
in Lincolnshire. So extensive indeed were those grants that his possessions resembled more the
dominions of a sovereign prince than the estates of a subject. He enjoyed, too, in the highest degree,
the confidence of the king, and was appointed joint justice general with Richard de Benefactis for
administering justice throughout the whole realm. While in that office, some great disturbers of the
public peace having refused to appear before him and his colleague in obedience to citation, the Earl
took up arms and defeated the rebels in a battle at Fagadune, when he is said, for the purpose of
striking terror, to have cut off the right foot of each of his prisoners. Of those rebels, Ralph Wahir
or Guarder, Earl of Norfolk, and Roger, Earl of Hereford, were the ringleaders. His lordship was
likewise highly esteemed by King William Rufus, and was created by that monarch Earl of Surrey.
He married Gundred, daughter of the Conqueror, and had issue, William, Reginald, Gundred Edith,
and another daughter who married Ernise de Colungis.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify">This potent noble built the castle of Holt and founded the priory at Lewes, in Sussex.  He resided
principally at the castle of Lewes, and had besides Castle Acre, in Norfolk, and noble castles at
Coningsburg and Sandal.  He died 24 June, 1088, and Dugdale gives to following curious account
of his parting hour.  "It is reported that this Earl William did violently detain certain lands from the
monks of Ely, for which, being often admonished by the abbot, and not making restitution, died
miserably.  And, though his death happened very far off the isle of Ely, the same night he died, the
abbot lying quietly in his bed and meditating on heavenly things, heard the soul of this earl, in its
carriage away by the devil, cry out loudly and with a known and distinct voice, Lord have mercy on
me; Lord have mercy on me.  And, moreover, that the next day after, the abbot acquainted all the
monks in chapter therewith.  And likewise, that about four days after, there came a messenger to
them from the wife of this earl with 100 shillings for the good of his soul, who told them that he died
the very hour that the abbot had heard the outcry.  But that neither the abbot nor any of the monks
would receive it, not thinking it safe for them to take the money of a damned person.  If this part of
the story as to the abbot&#8217;s hearing the noise be no truer than the last, viz., that his lady sent them 100
shillings, I shall deem it to be a mere fiction, in regard the lady was certainly dead about three years
before."  The earl was s. by his elder son, William de Warenne. [Sir Bernard Burke, &#8220;Dormant,
Abeyant, Forfeited, and Extinct Peerages,&#8221; Burke&#8217;s Peerage, Ltd., London, 1883, p. 568, Warren,

Clevenger, deposited a Collection of his Research Papers with the Atlantic County, New Jersey
Historical Society, Somers Mansion, Somers Point, New Jersey which states Abraham&#8217;s birth as
1741.  From looking at William M. Clevenger&#8217;s work he did not document all of his sources so
that leaves us with how the information was obtained.  A grandson Benjamin Franklin Clevenger
had a grave stone erected at the Sideling Hill Baptist Church Cemetery that states Abraham&#8217;s
date of birth as 1734.</p>

Downes in &#8220;Historical Sketch,&#8221; Fulton Democrat, 26 March 1925 and 2 April 1925 when listing
the children of Abraham and Mary omits Abraham and lists John and gives him Abraham&#8217;s
children.  It may be here that the confusion began.  Furthermore, Downes named the father as
Abraham J. which gives an indication that perhaps the son&#8217;s name was Abraham John Clevenger
and he was called &#8220;John&#8221; in the family, but in all legal documents which have persisted he was
named as Abraham.</p>

Wethersfield.  The major flaw  consists of statements that there were as many as three George
Chappells simultaneously residing in Wethersfield (cf., Vol. 1,  pp. 30, 72, 165, 258).  Sherman
Adams&#8217;s notes for example, led Stiles to include an unflattering reference to George, &#8220;a cooper&#8217;s
apprentice, 1637, or thereabouts, apparently not related to the [other two]a dissolute man, of little
account&#8221; Vol. 1, p. 258.  But in a deeply buried footnote in the second volume, Stiles says, &#8220;as to
this, we imagine [Adams] has confused him George the original emigrant, of Windsor&#8221;  Vol. 2,
p. 206.  A broader consideration of colony and town records, including those in New London,
show that all references must be to the same man, and that the characterization goes beyond the
facts.</p>

of Moels (IV): John de Moels, Lord Moels, brother and heir. On 18 July 1316 Richard Lovel was
granted the wardship of two parts of the lands late of Nicholas, John's brother, until the full age
of John. Having proved his age and done homage, he had livery of the lands of Roger de Moels,
his brother, 17 September 1325. He was ceremoniously knighted January 1326/7. On 5 May 1328
he had licence to grant to Margaret de Moels (his brother's widow), for life, a moiety of the
manor of Diptford and the hundred of Stanborough, Devon, in exchange for a grant of her
interest in the manor of Little Berkhampstead. He was a justice of the peace in 1329. On 7 May
1331 the escheator was ordered to take the lands of John de Moels, knight, into the King's hand
because he had gone outside the realm without licence, contrary to the proclamation. He was
granted the marriage of Elizabeth, late the wife of Edmund de Mortimer, 7 July 1333, but did not
marry her. On 21 November 1335 he had protection, being about to go beyond seas. He was
never summoned to Parliament. He married Joan, daughter of Richard Lovel, 1st Lord Lovel [of
Castle Cary] by Muriel, daughter and heir of Sir John de Soules. He died s..p.m., before 21
August 1337. On 1 September 1337 custody of his lands was granted to Thomas de Ferrars and
Thcobald de Mounteney. At his death the Barony of Moels is held, according to modern doctrine,
to have fallen into abeyance between his two daughters and coheirs, who were both born in
Dorset:  (i) Muriel, aged 15 in 1337, who married, without licence, after her father's death and
before the inquisition on his lands, Sir Thomas de Courtenay, for which they received pardon 27
August 1337. On 6 October 1337, Thomas de Courtenay having done fealty, he and Muriel
received their pourparty of her father's lands, and on 3 March 1337/8 their pourparty of knights'
fees. In 1349, on the death of her aunt Margaret, late wife of Nicholas de Moels, Muriel received
her share of the dower lands. Muriel and Thomas had one son, Hugh, who died s.p. and two
daughters, (a) Muriel, who m. Sir John de Dinham, and (b) Margaret, who margaret Sir Thomas
Peverel, and had two daughters (i) Eleanor, who m. Sir William Talbot and died s.p., and (ii)
Catherine, who married Sir Walter Hungerford .  (ii) Isabel, born at Marnhull, Dorset, 31 May
1376, but said to be aged "13 years and more" in September 1337, and 25 and more in April
1349. Having married, without licence, William de Botreaux, her lands were forfeited 30 August
1337, but they received pardon 6 October 1337. Isabel having proved her age on 18 June 1347,
and William's fealty and homage being respited until the King's return to England, they received
their pourparty of her father's lands 6 July 1347, and in 1349, on the death of her aunt Margaret,
late wife of Nicholas de Moels, Isabel received her share of the dower lands. Isabel and William
had a son William, who was summoned to Parliament in 1368. Isabel's greatgreat granddaughter,
Margaret, Baroness Botreaux, married Robert, Lord Hungerford, great grandson of Isabel's sister
Muriel, and thus united one moiety and half of the other moiety of the Barony of Moels. </p>

Arundel in 1242 43. He seems to have served throughout Henry's campaign in Gascony, 1253 54.
In August 1257 he was going on the King's service to Wales, and he was summoned for service
there, 1258, 1260 and 1263. In Oct. 1261 he was summoned to London, cum equis et armis, and
all possible forces, in a matter touching the King and Crown (d). Porchester castle was
committed to him, during pleasure, 12 April 1266. He is said to have married Agnes, daughter of
William de Cauntelo. He appears to have died between 11 March 1266/7 and the 25th of that
month (g). His widow (h) married, before 4 June 1271, John de Turville; they were both living in
1279. </p>

the King's lands in co. Cardigan, were committed to him in March 1277/8. In 1282 he was again

Devon (I) 1141: Baldwin de Reviers, son and heir of Richard de Reviers. On the rumour of the
King's death, in April 1136, he was one of the first to break into revolt. Seizing the royal castle of
Exeter, he sustained a long siege by the King, and was ultimately allowed to withdraw his forces
on giving up the castle. The King then proceeded to the Isle of Wight, took possession of the
island, and drove him, with his wife and children, into exile. He took refuge at the Court of the
Count of Anjou, and soon afterwards conducted a successful raid into Normandy. About Lent
1138 he was taken prisoner in Normandy by Enguerrand de Say, a partisan of King Stephen. He
returned to England in  the autumn of 1139, shortly before the arrival of the Empress Maud, and,
landing at Wareham, seized the castle of Corfe. This he defended successfully against the King,
forcing him eventually to raise the siege. By the Empress he was created Earl of Devon, probably
in 1141, and certainly before Midsummer in that year. He married Adelise. He died 4 June 1155,
and was buried (as was his said wife) in Quarr Abbey, which he had founded in 1132</p>

William Peverel of Nottingham, the elder, very little is known. He is usually said to have been an
illegitimate son of the Conqueror, but as this statement cannot be traced farther back than to the
time of the Tudors, it is worth little, or nothing. His wife's name was Adeline, and he had at least
four childrenWilliam, who dvp., another William, who succeeded him, and two daughters, Maud,
and Adelise, wife of Richard de Reviers. The Conqueror gave him extensive possessions,
afterwards known as the honour of Peverel, consisting of about 100 lordships in cos. Notts and
Northants, 14 in co. Derby, and some 20 in cos. Bucks, Leicester, Oxford, Beds, Berks, and
Essex. He founded the Priory of St. James at Nottingham and that of Lenton in the same county.
In the foundation chater of the latter he stated that it was founded. . . He died 28 Jan 1113/4.]</p>
