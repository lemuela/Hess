<p <="" p="">



</p><p style="margin-right:1.0in;margin-left:1.0in;text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">The time was a few years after the end of the Revolutionary

War. Pennsylvania and the other former English Colonies had just been united

under the Articles of Confederation and the Continental Congress. The country had

no Constitution, not even a President. Cornwallis had surrendered at Yorktown

only a year or so before. The Constitutional Convention was yet to convene, not

meeting until 1787. George Washington was yet to become President, not being

selected until 1789. <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p style="margin-right:1.0in;margin-left:1.0in;text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">The place was a part of Bedford County, (now Fulton County)

Pennsylvania. Fulton County is located north of the Maryland/Pennsylvania

border; south of Huntingdon County; east of Bedford County and west of Franklin

County. Currently, there are eleven townships in Fulton County, i.e., Ayr,

Belfast, Bethel, Bush Creek, Dublin, Licking Creek, Taylor, Thompson, Todd,

Wells and Union. <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p style="margin-right:1.0in;margin-left:1.0in;text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">The ancestral surname is <b>Hess</b> . A common variant of

this name is Hesse. Hess is an old and honored surname, of German origin. When

surnames come into general use the residents of Hesse, a state in Southwestern

Germany surrounding Hesse Castle, used Hess as their surname.</span><a

style="mso-endnote-id:edn1" href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title=""><span
 
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[1]<!--[endif]--></span></span></u></span></a><sup><span style="color:black"> </span></sup><span style="color:black">Later Hess families

resided not only in Hesse, but also in other parts of Germany, Switzerland,

France, the Netherlands, Austria, Bavaria, and Silesia. All of these were

probably of German origin. <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p style="margin-right:1.0in;margin-left:1.0in;text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">Several early Hess families lived in that section of

Bedford County, Pennsylvania that is now Fulton County. Fulton County,

Pennsylvania was formed out of Bedford County in 1850. Bedford County was

formed from Cumberland in 1771, which was formed from Lancaster County in 1729

that was formed from the original county, Chester, in 1682. <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p style="margin-right:1.0in;margin-left:1.0in;text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">One-third of the population of Pennsylvania was of German

ancestry.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn2" href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span 'mso-special-character:footnote'><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[2]<!--[endif]--></span></span></u></span></a><sup><span style="color:black"> </span></sup><span style="color:black">The first U.S.

Census of 1790 listed sixty-seven persons by the name of Hess/Hesse who were

residents of Pennsylvania and heads of families up from forty-five in 1780.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn3" href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span 'mso-special-character:footnote'><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[3]<!--[endif]--></span></span></u></span></a><sup><span style="color:black"> </span></sup><span style="color:black">Later in 1850, the

U.S. Census for Pennsylvania listed six hundred and twenty-six persons by the

name of Hess/Hesse, as heads of families or who resided in a household of a

different surname. Thirteen of these families along with two Hesses from other

households lived in Fulton County.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn4" href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span
'mso-special-character:footnote'><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[4]<!--[endif]--></span></span></u></span></a><sup><span style="color:black"> </span></sup><span style="color:black"><o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p style="margin-right:1.0in;margin-left:1.0in;text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">Early settlers of Fulton County when still a part of

Bedford County mostly likely followed one of two paths to the region, i.e.,

Braddock's Road or Forbe's Road.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn5" href="#_edn5" name="_ednref5" title=""><span 
'mso-special-character:footnote'><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[5]<!--[endif]--></span></span></u></span></a><sup><span style="color:black"> </span></sup><span style="color:black">Those roads were

old military roads that predated the Revolutionary War. Braddock's road

followed the Potomac River from Alexandria, Virginia, to Cumberland, Maryland,

then on to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Potomac's most northerly extent is at

Hancock, Maryland, just across the Pennsylvania/Maryland border from what is

now Fulton County, Pennsylvania. Forbe's road ran westward from Philadelphia

following roughly the current path of the Pennsylvania and earlier turnpikes

thru northern Fulton County. <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p style="margin-right:1.0in;margin-left:1.0in;text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">Although, probably not the first settlers in western

Pennsylvania, Hess ancestors were here before the Revolution, certainly no

later than 1774. How much earlier it is not certain. Many of the families

related to the Fulton County Hesses were from New Jersey. Among those that had

New Jersey roots were the Clevengers, Daniels, Fishers and Pittmans. These New

Jersey families moved to Fulton County, Pennsylvania just before the

Revolutionary War. Among these New Jersey families that were direct ancestors

of the Hesses were the Clevengers, Daniels and Fishers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p style="margin-right:1.0in;margin-left:1.0in;text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">Both Pennsylvania and Virginia were destinations for the

early migration from New Jersey. The natural route from New Jersey to the

Shenandoah Valley of Virginia was through southern Pennsylvania. During times

of Indian raids, this migration was severely curtailed or essentially

disappeared. <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p style="margin-right:1.0in;margin-left:1.0in;text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">Settlers were always discouraged by the English and by the

colonial governor of Pennsylvania. Even so, settlers were in the Fulton area in

the early 1700's. Local Indian raids often drove them from their farms and

homesteads into Fort Lyttleton. At times it was necessary to flee eastward as

Carlisle for protection. During the French and Indian War, many of the

homesteads were completely abandoned and many settlers did not return. Many

factors influenced the early westward movement. With the defeat of the French

and the signing of the Treaty of Paris, the French and Indian War came to an

end. France relinquished claims of all land east of the Mississippi. With

separate treaties with the Indians, most Indian hostilities ended. <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p style="margin-right:1.0in;margin-left:1.0in;text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">Leaving early in 1770, a number of Families from

Burlington, Essex, Monmouth and Morris Counties, New Jersey settled in what is

today Somerset, Bedford and Fulton Counties of Pennsylvania and in; the

Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. This early settlement in Fulton County was

general known as the Jersey Settlement.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn6" href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span 
'mso-special-character:footnote'><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[6]<!--[endif]--></span></span></u></span></a><sup><span style="color:black"> </span></sup><span style="color:black">Of the families

that intermarried with the Hesses in Fulton County, Pennsylvania, the earliest

presence in Fulton County were the Fishers and Clevengers. John and Frances

(Kuhl) Fisher's third child Paul was born in Bethel Twp., Bedford County,

Pennsylvania in 1767. Abraham Clevenger was in Fulton County in 1774.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn7" href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span 
'mso-special-character:footnote'><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[7]<!--[endif]--></span></span></u></span></a><sup><span style="color:black"> </span></sup><span style="color:black">Although these New

Jersey families are closely tied to the Hesses, no evidence at this time

indicates that the Fulton County Hesses were from New Jersey. <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p style="margin-right:1.0in;margin-left:1.0in;text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">There were, of course, other factors influencing emigration

to Fulton County. The economy was basically agricultural. They heavy influx of

settlers combined with prolific families created a tremendous demand for land,

for new families. Younger sons in large families who could not support

themselves on "the home place." These were, also adventuresome people

who were drawn by prospects of cheap and fertile land to the west. In

established counties in the eastern regions of Pennsylvania, many times

disputes between ethnic groups of the earlier and later settlers often

occurred. In fact in Lancaster County, it was so bad that the Proprietors would

not issue land grants to the Irish due to conflicts with the earlier German

settlers. Thus, the Irish settled much of the westward land. <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p style="margin-right:1.0in;margin-left:1.0in;text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">Most of these early Hesses and related families were

farmers and their daily life centered around the home and farm. A farmer would

work from sunrise till sunset. Occasionally they met with their neighbors at

such times as barn raising, corn husking, and weddings. There were occasional

trips to the nearby village where news and gossip were exchanged at a

mercantile store. The church also served as a social center as well as a place

of worship. <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p style="margin-right:1.0in;margin-left:1.0in;text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">Farm children learned first hand about agriculture and

livestock. The boys learned to use and repair tools, to make furniture, and to

grow and market the products of the farm. The girls learned to cook, spin and

weave cloth for rugs and clothing, nurse the sick, and care for children. The

girls also learned to make preserves, butter, cheese, soap, and candles. Senior

citizen housing, nursing homes, hospitals and social security were unheard of

since our early ancestors cared for their sick, elderly and unfortunate within

the family. Servants, apprentices, and adopted orphans were taken into the

circle of the family; and children grew up and for the most part remained on

the farm. A typical household lived pretty much to itself. Its members were

neither lonely nor discontented. The group consisted of many people with a

variety of common interests in subjects and activities leaving little time for

boredom. <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p style="margin-right:1.0in;margin-left:1.0in;text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">By today's standards, the pioneer women kept their

households running with only crude utensils. Their homes hummed with the

spinning wheel, the frequent task of candle making and meal preparation. Huge

kettles of hot water had to be lifted on and off the swinging

pothooks.&nbsp;Smaller kettles were used for soup or pot roast. Occasionally a

venison steak was browned on a round iron grill. The aroma of baking bread

would permeate the whole home. Butter was churned in a dasher churn and any idle

minute could be put to good use by scouring pewter plates, or by rubbing the

furniture with a bee’s waxed cloth. On a wall hung the warming pan that was

used to thaw out chilled beds. Nearby a gun and powder horn were always ready

for protection or a quick shot at a passing rabbit or deer to provide meat for

the table. <o:p></o:p></span></p>



<p style="margin-right:1.0in;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:1.0in;text-align:

justify"><span style="color:black">The parents were the real teachers. Their

lessons were taught in practical ways. At this time samplers became popular as

a test of a girl's skill at needlework. The schoolmasters of the day taught

little more than reading, writing and arithmetic. An unmarried female was

regarded as an economic liability. Girls commonly married while still in their

teens and a widow generally accepted a new suitor a short time after her

husband's death. There was a strong prejudice against bachelors, and special

taxes and restrictions were placed on them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:1.0in;margin-left:1.0in;text-align:justify"><span style="color:black">Valuable genealogical information was obtained during the

search for my Hess roots that took me to Pennsylvania's Bedford and Fulton

Counties. Abraham Hess was identified as my ancestor in a previous book.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn8" href="#_edn8" name="_ednref8" title=""><span 
'mso-special-character:footnote'><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[8]<!--[endif]--></span></span></u></span></a><sup><span style="color:black"> </span></sup><span style="color:black">In that book,

William Hess was mistakenly identified as Abraham's father. This mistake was

made since only one Abraham Hess had been identified as being in Bedford/Fulton

County. William had identified an Abraham as a son and heir in his will. It was

also known that Abraham was married to Anna "Ann" Fisher. The History

of Tonoloway Baptist Church identifies Abraham's wife as Eleanor and the

speculation was that somehow her name was really Eleanor and came to be called

Ann.</span><a style="mso-endnote-id:edn9" href="#_edn9" name="_ednref9" title=""><span 
'mso-special-character:footnote'><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[9]<!--[endif]--></span></span></u></span></a><sup><span style="color:black"> </span></sup><span style="color:black">This led to the

search of the Bethel and Belfast tax records and it was found that from 1802 to

1808 there was an Abraham in Bethel Twp. as well as an Abraham in Belfast Twp.

The latter was identified as my ancestor. Since William Hess resided in Bethel

Twp., this most likely identifies the Bethel Twp's. Abraham Hess as being a son

of William Hess. Based on the above I have ruled out William Hess of Bethel

Township as my ancestor. During my search, I have been able to identify several

of the early Bedford/Fulton Hes-Hess-Hesses Families. This book not only serves

to update the previous Hess book,<sup> </sup></span><a style="mso-endnote-id:

guide to the early Hesses of Bedford/Fulton County. Therefore, the reader may

use the book for more than an enumeration of my Hess roots. It is hoped that by

documenting the early Hesses, other researchers will be helped by the vast

amount of research that was necessary to document my roots. Mainly, these early

Hesses include the descendants of William Hess of Bethel Township, John Hess of

Ayr Township, and my ancestor Abraham Hess of Belfast Township. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
